### Why privacy is not important

- I don't care argument

- Human test definition: would the experiment be useful if the data were generated by a random process and not by a human~\cite{garfinkel2008irbs}

### Privacy 101

- Privacy v.s. Security
    - A user's bank account is hacked, the hacker takes the user's money. 
    - A user's friend knows the password and logs into the user's bank account to check the spending history. 
    - The bank sells users' data to a third party agency; the agency uses the user's shopping history to recommend something to that user, which may leverage the users' vulnerability. 

- [Information privacy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/equifax-mystery-where-is-the-data.html): always copy rarely cut.

####### Stories


- Google noted that visitors to its Ads Preference Manager are far more likely to edit their interest settings and remain opted in rather than to opt out. 
- In the Commission’s case against Google, the complaint
alleged that Google used the information of consumers who signed up for Gmail to populate a new social network, Google Buzz. The creation of that social network in some cases revealed previously private information about Gmail users’ most frequent email contacts.
