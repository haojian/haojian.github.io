### Nice mobile system papers in Privacy.

- [Apex: extending Android permission model and enforcement with user-defined runtime constraints](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1755688.1755732)


### Some good literature reviews.

- [Machine Learning with Adversaries](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-fa19/assets/lectures/lec10/10_adversarial_ml.pdf)
- [The privacy paradox – Investigating discrepancies between expressed privacy concerns and actual online behavior – A systematic literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585317302022)


### Privacy in communication

- [The corporate cultivation of digital resignation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444819833331?journalCode=nmsa)


### Privacy engineering

- [The challenges of privacy engineering](https://blog.xot.nl/2017/08/02/the-challenges-of-privacy-engineering/)
    - Most PETs focus on data minimisation or unlinkability, aiming to unconditionally protect the privacy of the user. The underlying threat model is based on not trusting anyone (government or businesses) with our personal data. This threat model is not always appropriate, and may be too strict to achieve reasonable solutions in practice.
    - a pretty good article. 



### Data ethics

- [Values and Ethics in Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/HCI-073)

### Why privacy is not important

- I don't care argument

- Human test definition: would the experiment be useful if the data were generated by a random process and not by a human~\cite{garfinkel2008irbs}

### Privacy 101

- Privacy v.s. Security
    - A user's bank account is hacked, the hacker takes the user's money. 
    - A user's friend knows the password and logs into the user's bank account to check the spending history. 
    - The bank sells users' data to a third party agency; the agency uses the user's shopping history to recommend something to that user, which may leverage the users' vulnerability. 

- [Information privacy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/equifax-mystery-where-is-the-data.html): always copy rarely cut.

####### Stories


- Google noted that visitors to its Ads Preference Manager are far more likely to edit their interest settings and remain opted in rather than to opt out. 
- In the Commission’s case against Google, the complaint
alleged that Google used the information of consumers who signed up for Gmail to populate a new social network, Google Buzz. The creation of that social network in some cases revealed previously private information about Gmail users’ most frequent email contacts. 
- The Commission’s complaint against Facebook alleged that Facebook’s sharing of users’ personal information beyond their privacy settings was harmful.
