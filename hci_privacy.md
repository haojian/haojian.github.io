### Papers & books shaped my understanding of privacy.


#### What’s privacy? 

- [A Taxonomy of Privacy by Daniel J. Solove](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=667622)
    - This paper argues that privacy is far too vague a concept to guide adjudication and lawmaking. Instead, Solove enumerates 16 activities that invade privacy and organizes them into four sequential groups: (1) information collection, (2) information processing, (3) information dissemination, and (4) invasion. While these 16 activities are not likely to be comprehensive, it allows us to have a concrete basis to discuss privacy. 
    - One of my favorite privacy argument is also from this paper: 
        ```
            Society is fraught with conflict and friction. Individuals, institutions, and governments can all engage in activities that have problematic effects on the lives of others. 
        ```
- [The Right to Privacy (1890)](https://archive.org/details/jstor-1321160/page/n1/mode/2up)
    - This 1890 paper is published before the information age. It helps understand 
- [The Transparent Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society)
- ['I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565)
- [Altman's Privacy regulation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_regulation_theory)

- Privacy v.s. Security. 
    - A user's bank account is hacked, the hacker takes the user's money. 
    - A user's friend knows the password and logs into the user's bank account to check the spending history. 
    - The bank sells users' data to a third-party agency; the agency uses the user's shopping history to recommend something to that user, which may leverage the users' vulnerability.

#### Privacy engineering

- [The challenges of privacy engineering](https://blog.xot.nl/2017/08/02/the-challenges-of-privacy-engineering/)
    - Most PETs focus on data minimisation or unlinkability, aiming to unconditionally protect the privacy of the user. The underlying threat model is based on not trusting anyone (government or businesses) with our personal data. This threat model is not always appropriate, and may be too strict to achieve reasonable solutions in practice.
    - a pretty good article.

#### Other privacy reading lists
- Reading list from Jason. [HCI and Privacy Reading Seminar Syllabus Spring 2012](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTlev3mmOTBQhlO8XBXe2z8bCoBKSbqweIhkRFrZUxU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1&hl=en_US&pli=1#gid=0)





### Stories

- Google noted that visitors to its Ads Preference Manager are far more likely to edit their interest settings and remain opted in rather than to opt out. 
- In the Commission’s case against Google, the complaint
alleged that Google used the information of consumers who signed up for Gmail to populate a new social network, Google Buzz. The creation of that social network in some cases revealed previously private information about Gmail users’ most frequent email contacts. 
- The Commission’s complaint against Facebook alleged that Facebook’s sharing of users’ personal information beyond their privacy settings was harmful.

###  Random snippets from haojian.



- Human test definition in IRB: would the experiment be useful if the data were generated by a random process and not by a human.



```
Privacy is essentially a lose-lose game because of trust issues. On the one hand, users are afraid that they no longer control the data once it leaves their home. On the other hand, developers are concerned that if they cannot reaccess the data, they collect data even more aggressively.

Feb. 01, 2021 - Haojian when working on Peekaboo.
```

```
The market of privacy lemons. 

Today's tension between developers and users resembles that between dealers and users in the used-car market. 

Users cannot differentiate developers with good privacy and those with bad privacy, so they treat them equally. Unfortunately, this pushes even well-intentioned developers to harness users' information. 

Similar to the used car market, there also exist many variations. For example, you may find an honest salesman everybody trusts. Such a dealer in the privacy market can be Dock Duck Go. What breaks these types of things is that protecting privacy is nearly impossible. Even if a user tries to do something to protect privacy, the information may leak from other unknown vendors.

    - 个人具有处置自己轻伤的权利。
    - 法律是家长主义。
    - 自由一定不能以彻底的放弃自由为代价，不能以丧失人的尊严为代价。

- 正义可能就像理念上的圆一样，人永远朝着正义去迈进。
    - 法律是一个有瑕疵的正义。法律是追求秩序的，但是很多时候维护秩序的力量会破坏秩序。
    - 人们放纵正义的情绪，像侠客精神，十步杀一人，千里不留行，这很爽。但这样维护正义的方式会突破正义。
    - 法律要强调程序正义，而不是人内心的正义。
