Mobile Audio 
==============

## Devices:

- iPhone 5: 3 microphones (One on the front, one on the bottom, and one on the back). 2 speakers (back and front)

## Typical Audio Signal design requirement

- Dealing with multi-user communication system that share the same time-slots and the same bandwidth.

- Requirement (rank through priority)
	- can detect the exact beginning of the signal
	- each signal in the set is easy to distinguish from (apossibly time-shifted version of) every other signal in the set.
	- each signal in the set is easy to distinguish from a time-shifted version ofitself; (signal from the same phone)
	- fast and easy to process
	- immune to doppler effects


## Audio Ranging Papers

- Robust Range Estimation Using Acoustic and Multimodal Sensing:
	- PN sequence based. 
	- Mobile speakers and microphones' rated power is 0.1 w
	- pseudo-noise sequences as the acoustic signal in most work
	- binary phase shift keying wave form
	- BPSK at 12 kHz chip rate. 
	- Using direct sequence based on a codes from 511 bit code.
	- using the correleation with a different sequence to simulate the noise level. 


- Exploiting Quasi-Orthogonal Chirp signals in Multi-user access communication systems
	- Chirp signal are known to immune to Doppler shift.
	- Chirp rates are selected to keep the used set of chirp signals quasi-orthogonal. (didn't understand the selection criteria yet)
	
- Quasi-orthogonal chirp signals Design for Multi-user CSS system
	- priciples for choosing signal
		- time bandwidth product TmBw >=20 their cross-correlation is less than 0.2
		- cross correlation p <= 0.4. small bit error rate change.
		
- SwordFight: Enabling a new class of Phone-to-Phone Action Games on Commodity Phones
	- 12 Hz with 2cm median error while withstanding up to 0dB noise, multipath and Doppler effect
	- Realtime correlation algorithm based on a special chirp.
	- Addressed dopler effects.
	- Compute auto-correlation before cross-correlation.
	- Deal with occasional tone loss. two alternating codes.
