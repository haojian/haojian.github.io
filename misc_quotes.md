David Pujol: When I first applied, my goal was to impress the reviewers. I tried — in my opinion, unsuccessfully — to make my research sound like some grand project that would change how we view data. In reality, it wasn’t that. I ended up writing a confusing, unfocused, and overly technical piece that failed to convey the information that I wanted it to.

I eventually learned that most projects don’t need to be major, paradigm-changing work. In fact, most are small steps in the right direction.

The complexity of a lot of the problems [in the world] and the means for solving them are just getting to be too much. The time available for solving a lot of the problems is getting shorter and shorter. So the urgency goes up… The complexity/urgency factor had transcended what humans can cope with.

And so the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.
As soon as you saw people as things to be measured, they didn't measure up. What would run through the streets soon enough wouldn't be a revolution or a riot.

有科学的技能，未必有科学的素质；有科学的素质，未必有科学的品格. - 王小波，沉默的大多数

最近，有一批自然科学家签名，要求警惕种种伪科学，此举来得非常及时。《老残游记》上说，中国有“北拳南革”两大祸患。当然，“南革”的说法是对革命者的诬蔑，但“北拳”的确是中国的一大隐患。中国人——尤其是社会的下层——有迷信的传统，在社会动荡、生活有压力时，简直就是渴望迷信。此时有人来装神弄鬼，就会一哄而起，造成大的灾难。这种流行性的迷信之所以可怕，在于它会使群众变得不可理喻。这是中国文化传统里最深的隐患。宣传科学，崇尚理性，可以克制这种隐患；宣扬种种不可信的东西，是触发这种隐患。作家应该有社会责任感，不可为一点稿酬，就来为祸人间。- http://www.kanunu8.com/book3/7061/147845.html
