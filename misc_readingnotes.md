* [Confounding variables in machine learning](http://www.rbeesoft.com/blog/?p=153)
	* Imagine that you are mostly interested in predicting something and that you don’t care so much about identifying true cause-and-effect relationships. Fortunately, prediction doesn’t always require a causal relationship between predictor and response. Instead, a proxy variable that is simply correlated to the response, and is easier to obtain than a causally connected variable, might well do the job.

* [Machine Bias - There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks.](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
	* i still feel it's hard to handle such a sensitive problem. as mentioned by the article in "war of math destruction", a collective success doesn't guarantee an individual fairness. 
	* i think the better way to approach that problem is the advertising targeting story.
	* what the algorithm provides seem just a recommendation rather than a final decision.
	* this looks suspicious: "Northpointe’s core product is a set of scores derived from 137 questions that are either answered by defendants or pulled from criminal records. Race is not one of the questions.". proxy?

	* Vulfpeck put up an album of complete silence and told their fans to listen to it on repeat overnight. And then they paid their fans back with a free concert + free beer AND.....each fan received $1 on their way out in appreciation of streaming the silence. I know because I was there. They rock.
