	- Although the same device being central and peribheral at the same time is not standard as per Bluetooth current specification, iOS currently supports it.

|-----------------------------------|------------|--------|
| running as a BLE peripheral       |    no      |   yes  |
| running as a BLE center           |    yes     |   yes  |


Thoughout 
-----------
- the iPhone 4S won't accept any lower Conn_Interval values than 0x0f. 
- Conn_Interval = 0x000f = 18.75 ms (Apple's hardware guideline claimed it at 20ms)
- 20 bytes * 50 hz * 8 = 8 kbit/s (disable callback)

Connections
-----------
A slave(server/prepheral) may only be connected to a single master, but a master may be connected to multiple slaves. (up to 8)

The BLE protocol specification requires that the maximum data payload size for these operations is 20 bytes, or in the case of read operations, 22 bytes. BLE is built for low power consumption, for infrequent short-burst data transmissions. Sending lots of data is possible, but usually ends up being less efficient than classic Bluetooth when trying to achieve maximum throughput.

[Android 4.4.1 connections can be up to 8](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/12/13/whats-really-new-in-android-4-4-2/)
>Bluetooth LE Connections
Prior to 4.4.1, the number of devices that could be simultaneously connected to an Android device topped out at four. With a commit put in before the 4.4.1 update, that limit is bumped up to seven.

Points we may need to address in the paper:
------------

1. Nearby WLAN devices were turned off during the measurements because WLANs and Bluetooth share the same frequency band [15].
2. Traditional bluetooth has two problem in locationing: adjust signal strength when signals become too strong or too weak, makeing any subsequent distance measurements based on signal strength unreliable. Takes a lot of time for new device to be fully discovered.

```
//Estimote's code snippet.
// based on observation rssi is not getting bigger then -30
// so it changes from -30 to -100 so we normalize
float distFactor = ((float)self.selectedBeacon.rssi + 30) / -70;      
float newYPos = self.dotMinPos + distFactor * self.dotRange;
self.positionDot.center = CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width / 2, newYPos);
