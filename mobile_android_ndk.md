Android NDK 
==============

@[dev | android | c/c++]

Environment Set-up

- Don't use the Eclipse plugin - “Add native support”. Follow this [instuction](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/android/Android_NDK.html) instead. :-D 
    - Reason: With the new ADT 20, if the project has a jni folder or/and an Android.mk file the c++ nature is added by the plugin by default. [reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11504258/how-to-remove-native-support-from-an-android-project-in-eclipse-because-eclipse)

- Use ~/.profile to store the environment setting.
