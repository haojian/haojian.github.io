Signal Processing
===========

## Kalman filter

- [pykalman](https://pykalman.github.io/)
	- easy to use, install and apply.
	
- [Some Python Implementations of the Kalman Filter](https://github.com/balzer82/Kalman)
	- lots of good application examples
	
- [Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python) 
	- a very good top-down learning tutorial

## Signal Smoothing

- different smoothing methods work differently depending on the nature of the signal and noise contained in the signal. Each method offers a different performance to best show significant aspects of your results.
	- Savitzky-Golay seeks to preserve shapes of peaks
	- Adjacent Averaging does wide smoothing.
	- the percentile filter (especially 50% percentile filter or median filter) allows you to eliminate noise with abnormal amplitude.
