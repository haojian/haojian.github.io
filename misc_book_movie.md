★★★★★ [Who Gets What ― and Why: The New Economics of Matchmaking and Market Design](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Gets-What-Why-Matchmaking/dp/0544705289) by Alvin Roth

```
To achieve efficient outcomes, marketplaces need make markets sufficiently
• Thick(Enough potential transactions available at one time)
• Uncongested (Enough time for offers to be made, accepted, rejected transactions carried out)
• Safe (Safe to participate, and to reveal relevant preferences)
```

★★★★ [The aftermath](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5977276/)
