#### Inspiring research talks 

Michael Stonebraker: [Top Ten Big Data Blunders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SK8jdBhGNI)
<pre>
    (1) Not Planning to Move EVERYTHING to the Cloud. 
    (2) Outsourcing your new stuff to Palantir, IBM, Mu Sigma.
    (3) Succumbing to the "Innovator's Dilemma"
    (4) Working for a Company That is not Trying to do Something about the "Sins of the Past"
</pre>


Junchen Jiang: [Enabling Data-Driven Optimization of Quality of Experience in Internet Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRz9EYibEz4&t=1329s)
<pre>
    Increasing complex networked system + means to collect & process massive data => Optimizing the network streaming through a data driven approach.
</pre>

Jeff Heer: [A brief history of data visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00g9Q9stBo)
<pre> The visualization pipelines have been consistent behind many different techniques: (raw data -[data transformation]-> data tabels -[visual encodings]-> visual structures -[view transformations]-> views). 
</pre>


Aditya Nori: [Probabilistic Programming: Algorithms, Applications and Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4sFD9RyJrs)
<pre> Two challenges: (1) bringing data into programs (numerous new sources, conversion); (2) reasoning with data. 

Two benefits of probabilistic programming: (1) hides complexity of inference techniques; (2) requires much less expertise to write and experiment with ML models.
</pre>



Sumit Gulwani: [programming by examples: pl meets ml](https://youtu.be/-IjU2-Pi6gg?t=2480)

Amy Ko: [Big ideas behind the Whyline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx7g-T10WxQ)
<pre>
A nice summary of whyline: (1) Debugging is slow becuase developers iteratively test brittle hypotheses about what caused a failure by manually collecting runtime data. (2) Debugging would be faster if developers worked backwards from well-understood failure to cause, relying on dynamic dependencies precisely gathered by a tool. 
</pre>

Arvind Satyanayaran, [Declarative Interactive Design for Data Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAnxCRHn2Rw)

<pre>
    (1) Declarative primitives for interaction. (2) the reactive nature of visualization architecture.
</pre>

Juho Kim: [Learnersourcing: Improving Learning with Collective Learner Activity](https://www.slideshare.net/mcpanic/20150730-thesisdefenseweb)

<pre>
    The last few slides on Learning @ Scale inspired me to get a Ph.D.. 
</pre>



Dave Patterson: [A new golden age for computer architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctwj53r07yI)
<pre>
    There are many versions of this talk. I like this one most. 

    (1) Simple, verifiable, alternable, free and open architecture and implemetations. That's also something I want achieve through Peekaboo. 
    
    (2) Agile hardware development. Small teams do short development between working but incomplete prototypes and get customer feedback per step. A very nice summarization of the "agile" part.
