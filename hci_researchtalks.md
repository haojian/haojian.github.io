Amy Ko: [Big ideas behind the Whyline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx7g-T10WxQ)
<pre>
A nice summary of whyline: (1) Debugging is slow becuase developers iteratively test brittle hypotheses about what caused a failure by manually collecting runtime data. (2)Debugging would be faster if developers worked backwards from well-understood failure to cause, relying on dynamic dependencies precisely gathered by a tool. 

Tools <=> big ideas <=> key insights.

Arvind Satyanayaran, [Declarative Interactive Design for Data Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAnxCRHn2Rw)

<pre>
    Declarative primitives for interaction: 
    (1) Model user input as streaming data; (2) extend techniques from functional reactive programming (FRP) and streaming database; (3) when events occur, interactive state is automatically recomputed. Data values are recalculated, and the visualization is re-rendered.
