### Why HCI is a discipline


- Heuristic evaluation
    - In traditional user testing, the experimenter interprets users’ user testing action to infer how these actions are related to the usability issues.
    - In heuristic evaluation, the evaluators go through the interface from users’ perspective, assess the usability and report their comments.


- Speed dating in Ubicomp
    - Traditional interviews ask participants to speculate on two things: (1) the imagined future situations and (2) how tech modify them. This is very challenging for end users.  Instead, speed dating creates scenarios that fall on both sides of the boundaries (i.e., situation and users’ behavior)
    - Present multiple ideas to end users so they can critique and compare. 
    - Focuses on the need but not the implementation/technology.


Usability Engineering, Jakob Nielsen (for heuristic evaluation)
Contextual Design, Karen Holtzblatt (for contextual inquiry)
Prototyping for Tiny Fingers, Marc Rettig (I don't think he invented paper prototyping, but I believe this article popularized it... I might be wrong here)
The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, Card Moran Newell (for lots of things, one of which is GOMS)
Cognitive Walkthrough (I'm not sure what a good reference is for this method)
A/B studies at large scale (not sure what a good reference is for this method)
Automated tools for accessibility (in particular, web accessibility)
Card sorting (not sure what a good reference is for that)
Parallel design, see Steven Dow's papers on that
Task Analysis (not sure what best reference is for that)
Remote user testing (not sure what best reference is for that)
Suggest going to usability.gov, they have a section on methods, which seems to be a useful list.
